In the shitty future, Emperor Reagan IV attempted economic stimulus by setting interest rates to negative thirty percent.

This resulted in the average asking price of a studio apartment inflating to like three bajillion dollars. 

To avoid wage increases, software companies decided to pump the moon with breathable air and build housing for their employees on it.

Angered by humanity's aggroance, the Divine Spirit of the Moon released Lunarbeasts to chase away the newfound Earthling residents from her domain.

In order to repel the giants threatening the tech parks, the humanity constructed the Lunar Satellite Laser Array.

The orbiting cannons lacked precision though, and required spotters on the ground to precisely aim for the Lunarbeast's weak spots.

Naturally, these spotters needed passion for the job.
